# vanillaJS-Projects

Collection of 15 different basic vanilla JavaScript projects coded with basic JavaScript skills (along with some HTML and CSS). By looking at the source code for each of these simple JavaScript projects we'll start to understand how we can build a new version of the same idea, or build on the original open-source code to add your own twists and tweaks.
